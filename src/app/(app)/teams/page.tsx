// /teams — the Cribble Team surface. Public and shareable (it sits on the
// site-lock allowlist), so this wrapper is a server component that owns
// the page metadata; everything visible lives in client components under
// src/components/teams/. The page is adaptive: TeamsHub probes the
// viewer's account and shows TEAM-tier companies their command deck,
// while everyone else gets the Team-plan buy page. (The recruitment
// board lives on the TEAMS leaderboard's HIRING tab, not here.) The
// /team console (singular) stays the private roster surface for
// accounts that already fly colors.
