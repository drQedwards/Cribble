            This privacy policy covers the Cribble website at cribble.dev and
            the Cribble browser extension. Cribble measures which AI tools you
            use and for how long, and turns that into scores, streaks, and
            leaderboards. It never reads what you type, what a model says
            back, or anything else on the page.

          <Section index={1} title="What the extension collects">
            <p>
              The extension watches a fixed list of known AI tool domains.
              While a tab on one of those domains is open, it records:
            </p>
            <ul className="mt-5 space-y-3">
              <CollectedItem text="Domains you visit among tracked AI tools (chatgpt.com, claude.ai, …)" />
              <CollectedItem text="Active vs idle minutes per tab" />
              <CollectedItem text="Number of visits per tool" />
              <CollectedItem text="Sync timestamps, used for streak math" />
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-5">
              Browsing anywhere outside that list is never observed or
              recorded. Collected activity is synced to your Cribble account
              and attributed to the browser it came from.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section index={2} title="What the extension never collects">
            <ul className="space-y-3">
              <NeverItem text="Your prompts. Ever." />
              <NeverItem text="The model's responses" />
              <NeverItem text="Your chat history or files" />
              <NeverItem text="Keystrokes, clipboard contents, or screen captures" />
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-5">
              The extension does not read, store, or transmit page content
              from any site, including the AI tools it tracks. It logs the
              session, never the conversation.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section index={3} title="What your account stores">
            <p>
              Signing in to cribble.dev uses OAuth through GitHub or X. We
              never see your password. Your account stores:
            </p>
            <ul className="mt-5 space-y-3">
              <CollectedItem text="Your OAuth identity: username, display name, and avatar from GitHub or X" />
              <CollectedItem text="Profile details you choose to add (role, goals, preferred tools)" />
              <CollectedItem text="Usage stats derived from extension data: scores, streaks, and ranks" />
              <CollectedItem text="Records linking your browser extension to your account" />
              <CollectedItem text="Your browser's timezone and a two-letter country code, used as coarse context for aggregate trends" />
              <CollectedItem text="If you enable Cribble Agent: machine name, IANA timezone, coding-agent/model identifiers, event timestamps, token counts, and estimated cost (never prompts, responses, files, or message content)" />
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-5">
              The timezone is reported by your browser. The country code is
              derived from request metadata at the moment the extension
              syncs — the IP address it comes from is never stored.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section index={4} title="What the website counts">
            <p>
              cribble.dev itself keeps two small counts, separate from
              the extension and your account:
            </p>
            <ul className="mt-5 space-y-3">
              <CollectedItem text="Pageviews, via Vercel Analytics — no cookies, no personal identifiers" />
              <CollectedItem text="Public traffic stats, via GoatCounter — cookie-free pageviews, referrers, and countries anyone can open from the leaderboard ticker" />
              <CollectedItem text="How many people are on the site right now, and how many in the last 12 hours, shown on the leaderboard ticker" />
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-5">
              GoatCounter never stores IP addresses or cookies. The live
              ticker hashes a request fingerprint and stores only that
              hash — never the IP, never a cookie, never a page path.
              Hashes older than 12 hours are deleted. None of this is
              tied to accounts, used to target ads, or sold.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section index={5} title="How your data is used">
            <p>
              Usage data exists first to compute your scores, streaks, and
              leaderboard positions. Leaderboards and profiles are visible
              to other Cribble users, so your username, avatar, and scores
              are public within the app.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We may also publish aggregated, anonymized usage trends — for
              example, total active minutes per AI tool across all users.
              Aggregates are computed over minimum cohort sizes so they can
              never identify an individual. Because a true aggregate
              contains no individual data, aggregates computed before you
              delete your account persist after it. If you would rather not
              be counted at all, you can opt out of aggregate insights in
              settings.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We do not sell your data, and we do not share it with third
              parties, except for the infrastructure providers (hosting and
              database services) that process it on our behalf to run
              Cribble.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              If Cribble is ever acquired or merged into another company,
              your data transfers with it under the same commitments in this
              policy.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Cribble Agent token facts stay private unless you explicitly
              join the Burn Board. The public board receives only your public
              profile and aggregated totals and breakdowns; it never exposes
              event rows, client UUIDs, machine names, or API-key details.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section index={6} title="Retention and deletion">
            <p>
              Your data is retained while your account is active. You can
              delete your account at any time from the in-app settings; this
              permanently removes your usage events, daily metrics, scores,
              linked devices, notifications, and sessions.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              One carve-out: anonymized aggregates already computed under
              Section 5 persist after deletion. They hold totals across many
              users, no individual rows, and nothing that can be traced back
              to you.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Uninstalling the extension stops all collection immediately —
              nothing is gathered without it.
