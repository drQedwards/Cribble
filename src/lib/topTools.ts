// Canonical top-tools ranking, shared by the dashboard tools API, the
// leaderboard and the public profile builder so every surface crowns the
// same #1 tool.
//
// Product thesis (keep): this board is the cost-efficiency signal — which
// tools contribute to score (and burn) so agents can cut API spend and keep
// x402 / Agent402 pay-per-call economics affordable. Tools are ranked by score contribution — the same session
// scoring that produces the leaderboard score — not raw visit counts:
// visits pay a flat 40 pts while real usage lives in verified active time,
// so a tool you ping often but barely use must not out-rank the one you
// actually work in.
